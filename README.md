# jot-sync

Implement a basic note taking app with the following functionality:

- A "New Note" button that opens a modal dialog to enter the title and content for a new note
- In the new note dialog, an "Add" button to save the note, and a "Cancel" button to discard it
- Display existing notes in a grid layout 
- Allow editing an existing note by clicking on it, which opens the edit modal dialog
- In the edit note dialog, a "Save" button to update the note, and a "Cancel" button to discard changes
- A delete button on each note to remove it
- Store notes in the browser's local storage so they persist across page reloads
- A clean and simple design

Don't worry about more advanced features like search, tags, rich text, images etc. We'll add those later if needed.
